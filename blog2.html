            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Over two billion metric tons of waste are generated annually, with projections indicating this will rise to 3.78 billion metric tons by 2050. Only a small percentage of waste is recycled, while the rest is either dumped, burned, or ends up in landfills, contributing to widespread environmental pollution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Waste contributes significantly to climate change, with open landfills accounting for 31% of global waste disposal. These landfills release greenhouse gases like methane, a potent contributor to climate change with warming effects over 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide. Recent studies suggest that U.S. landfill emissions are even higher than reported, highlighting the urgent need for better waste management.

            <h2>Trash Exacerbates Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Open landfills account for 31% of global waste disposal, releasing harmful greenhouse gases like methane, which contribute significantly to climate change. These emissions are far higher than government estimates, undermining global climate mitigation efforts. A recent study from Harvard revealed that landfill emissions in the U.S. are 77% higher than previously reported.</p>

            <h2>Trash Is Killing Wildlife</h2>
           
            <p> Plastic pollution in the oceans is devastating marine life. An estimated 19 to 23 million tons of plastic waste enter oceans each year, harming over 1,500 species, including whales, sea turtles, and seabirds. Many marine species ingest plastics or become entangled in them, leading to injury or death. Plastic waste is even entering the human food chain through seafood consumption.</p>

            <h2>Trash Impacts Human Health</h2>
            <p>Many plastic products contain harmful chemicals like PFAS, which are linked to serious health issues, including cancer, infertility, and developmental problems. These chemicals, known as "forever chemicals," enter the environment through improper waste disposal, posing long-term risks to human and environmental health.</p>

            <h2>Call to Action</h2>
            <p>The blog emphasizes the importance of reducing waste by rejecting single-use plastics, avoiding fast fashion, and making mindful consumption choices. It urges individuals to take responsibility for their waste, support recycling initiatives, and make sustainable lifestyle changes to protect both human health and the environment.</p>
